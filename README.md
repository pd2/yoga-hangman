I have developed a simple web based game. 

It is based on the Hangman game but here I show you a picture of a person doing an Asana and all you need to do is guess the benefit of doing that particular Asana. 

For each Asana I have composed one sentence with utmost 50 letters that describes the main benefit of doing that Asana. In the Hangman game, the player needs to guess this 50 letter sentence one letter at a time. You get three strikes (wrong guesses) to complete the game.

Guessing the name of Asana would borrow on the player's memorization skills and would limit it to those players who already know a lot about yoga. So instead guessing the benefit of doing an Asana would  borrow on their analytical and reasoning skills given that I show a photo of the Asana. 

I hope everyone finds the game interesting including those who are new to yoga.
